# Finding Codes Reference

Common cairn lint finding codes, their severities, and remediation steps. Not every emitted code is listed here; see `docs/registries/error-codes.md` for the full registry.

## Error findings (block hooks)

These findings cause `cairn hook structural` and `cairn hook all` to exit 1 (fail).

### CAIRN_INTEGRITY_DUPLICATE_ID

**Severity:** Error
**Meaning:** Same node ID appears more than once in the blueprint.
**Remediation:** Remove the duplicate declaration from `cairn.blueprint`.

### CAIRN_INTEGRITY_INVALID_EDGE_ENDPOINT

**Severity:** Error
**Meaning:** Edge references a node ID not in the graph.
**Remediation:** Fix the edge's `from` or `to` ID in `cairn.blueprint` to reference an existing node.

### CAIRN_INTERFACE_HASH_CHANGED

**Severity:** Error
**Meaning:** A module's public interface (exported symbols, function signatures) has changed since the last `cairn scan` wrote `.cairn/state/interface-hashes.json`.
**Remediation:** Run `cairn scan` to update the baseline. If the interface change was intentional, the new hash becomes the baseline. If unintentional, revert the interface change.

### CAIRN_REVIEW_UNKNOWN_NODE

**Severity:** Error
**Meaning:** A review references a node ID that doesn't exist in the blueprint.
**Remediation:** Fix the `node:` or `nodes:` field in the artefact's frontmatter to reference a valid node ID. Run `cairn get <id>` to verify node existence.

### CAIRN_ORDER_CYCLE

**Severity:** Error
**Meaning:** The dependency edge graph contains a cycle. Cairn requires a DAG (directed acyclic graph).
**Remediation:** Remove or redirect one of the edges in the cycle. Use `cairn deps <node> --transitive` to trace the dependency chain.

### CAIRN_BLUEPRINT_CHANGE_NO_DECISION (CA002)

**Severity:** Error
**Meaning:** The blueprint's structural shape changed for a node (module added, removed, or reassigned across containers) but no decision artefact has that node's ID in its `nodes` field.
**Remediation:** Author a decision artefact covering the changed node. The decision should explain why the structural change was made. Only active decisions (proposed or accepted) satisfy the gate; deprecated or superseded decisions do not count. First scan creates a baseline; the gate only fires on subsequent scans when a previous snapshot exists. If no decisions exist in the project at all, the gate is skipped.

### CT001

**Severity:** Error
**Meaning:** Interface contradiction: multiple targets claim the same contract role with divergent interfaces.
**Remediation:** Review the targets for the conflicting contract role. Either align their interfaces or mark the asymmetry as intentional via `multi_target.intentional_asymmetry` in `cairn.config.yaml`:

```yaml
multi_target:
  intentional_asymmetry:
    node: <node-id>
    reason: <explanation>
```

## Warning findings (advisory)

These findings are surfaced in `cairn hook tension` and in `cairn lint` output but do not block commits.

### CAIRN_PROVENANCE_NO_DECISION (CA001)

**Severity:** Warning
**Meaning:** A leaf node in the blueprint has no accepted decision artefact covering it (no decision has this node's ID in its `nodes` field).
**Remediation:** Author a decision artefact with `nodes: [<this-node-id>]` and `status: accepted` explaining why this module exists and how it's shaped. Only fires when at least one decision exists in the project (avoids noise in fresh projects).

### CAIRN_ARTEFACT_FILENAME_DRIFT (CA038)

**Severity:** Warning
**Meaning:** An artefact filename does not match its `id`. For a decision, research, or source the filename stem must be the `id` with its `dec.`/`res.`/`src.` prefix stripped, so `id: dec.no-orchestrator` belongs in `no-orchestrator.md`. Todos are the exception and keep `todo.<slug>.md`, because `cairn todo new` and `cairn todo set` resolve slugs through that path.
**Remediation:** Rename the file to the name the finding reports. Renaming changes no `id`, so no provenance link breaks, but prose that cites the old path must be updated in the same change. See `dec.artefact-layout-authority`.

## Info findings (informational)

These findings are surfaced in `cairn lint` and `cairn scan` output but do not block any hook.

### CAIRN_RECONCILE_ORPHANED_FILE

**Severity:** Info
**Meaning:** A file exists on disk but no module in `cairn.blueprint` claims it via a `path` declaration.
**Remediation:**
1. Add the file's directory or path to an existing module's `path` declaration, OR
2. Declare a new Module in `cairn.blueprint` with a `path` covering this file, OR
3. Add the path to `exclude_paths` in `cairn.config.yaml` if it's intentionally outside the graph

### CAIRN_SOURCE_UNVERIFIED

**Severity:** Info
**Meaning:** A source artefact has `verification: unverified` in its frontmatter, meaning its contents have not been checked against the original.
**Remediation:** Verify the source against the original and update the frontmatter to `verification: verified` (with a `sha256` field), `verification: external` (for URL-based sources), or `verification: tracked` (for a live in-repo path read as it stands).

## CLI invocation errors (not scan findings)

### CAIRN_CLI_MISSING_NODE

**Severity:** Error, reported at invocation (usage error, exit 2); never produced by `cairn scan` or `cairn lint` and never blocks a hook.
**Meaning:** A CLI command that requires a node argument was called without one.
**Remediation:** Provide a node ID as the argument: `cairn get <node.id>`.
