# Feature implementation

Goal: add behaviour that the graph still describes correctly afterwards.

## Query sequence

```bash
cairn context                            # find the area that should own this
cairn get <node> --json                  # confirm ownership and current paths
cairn contract <node>                    # the interface you are extending
cairn rationale <node>                   # decisions that constrain the design
cairn deps <node> --direction in         # who consumes what you are about to change
cairn todos <node> --status open         # work already claimed here
cairn neighbourhood <node> --include-changes    # an active change may already touch it
cairn frontier                           # if the feature is a declared ghost node
```

Settle ownership before writing code. A feature implemented in the wrong node
produces a correct diff and a wrong graph, and the fix is a later migration.

## Before you write

Name the outcome, the nearest place it becomes observable, and the evidence that
will prove it there. For substantial work, capture that in a change first with the
`cairn-propose` skill, which exists for exactly this.

## While you write

- Every new file falls under a node `path`, tests included. If none fits, extend a
  node's paths or declare a new Module.
- Every new cross-module call gets a blueprint edge:
  `from.id -> to.id "relationship label"`. Check for a cycle first with
  `cairn deps <target> --transitive`.
- User-facing strings belong wherever the repository centralises them; check its
  conventions rather than hardcoding.
- Changed behaviour gets a test.

## From graph to source

The graph tells you where the feature belongs and what it may touch; it does not
design the feature. Read the contract and the neighbouring implementation to
match existing patterns, and use the language server to check that a new
signature breaks no existing caller; the span and language-server discipline is
in `graph-navigation.md`.

## Extending a ghost node

`cairn frontier` lists declared-but-unbuilt nodes that are buildable now, meaning
their dependencies exist. Implementing one is the cheapest kind of feature: the
node, its edges, and often its contract are already declared, so the work is to
make the code match the declaration and let `cairn scan` confirm the transition
from ghost to synced.

## Verify

Run the router's gate plus the repository's own gates, plus evidence at the
boundary the feature is claimed at. If structure changed or you made a
non-obvious tradeoff, record a decision in `meta/decisions/`
(`cairn decision new <slug> --node <id>`).
